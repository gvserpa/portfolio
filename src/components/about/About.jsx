        <p>
          I am a web developer passionate about technology, currently based in
          Australia and about to complete my IT degree. Over the past few years,
          I have been focused on studying and practicing both front-end and
          back-end development, working mainly with JavaScript, React, Node.js,
          and AWS. I have built real-world projects such as corporate websites
          and applications with APIs, always aiming to combine design,
          performance, and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to create digital solutions that simplify peopleâ€™s lives
          and add value to businesses. I have experience across the entire
          development cycle, from architecture and responsiveness to cloud
          deployment. I am constantly learning and open to new challenges that
          allow me to grow as a programmer and contribute meaningfully to
          innovative projects.
